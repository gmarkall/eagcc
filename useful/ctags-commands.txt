How to navigate over source objects in Vi Editor?
-------------------------------------------------
	
        <ctrl> ]                       Go  to  the  definition  of  the  source
                                       object on which  the cursor is currently
                                       positioned
        <ctrl> t                       Return  to the  location from  where the
                                       above keystrokes (<ctrl> ]) were used
        :tnext                         This  command is  useful when  there are
                                       multiple matches for a source object
                                       Go to  the next  definition of  the last
                                       navigated source object
        :tprev                         This  command is  useful when  there are
                                       multiple matches for a source object
                                       Go  to the  previous  definition of  the
                                       last navigated source object
