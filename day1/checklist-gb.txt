Checklist for Gray Box Probing Assignments
==========================================

The assignments  have been  designed with specific  learning objectives.
The following  self-assessment list should give  you a fair idea  of the
extent to which you have learnt the expected material.

Please try to respond to these statements after doing the assignments on
Gray  Box Probing.  Your responses  to the  statements could  be: `Yes',
`No', or  `Partly', or `I am  not sure'. In  case you are unable  to say
`Yes' for many  of the statements, we  advise you to talk  to a Teaching
Assistant to clarify the  concepts. If the need be, we  will try to find
someone to explain the concepts later in the evening.

1)  I know how to generate GIMPLE dumps.
    a)  I can ask for a particular pass or dump all passes.
    b)  I can ask for a human readable GIMPLE or the RAW gimple structures.
2)  I understand the GIMPLE intermediate representation.
    a)  I know the different types of GIMPLE statements.
    b)  I understand the different components of a GIMPLE statement.
3)  I understand the conversion of C source code to GIMPLE.
    a)  I know how a statement is broken down into GIMPLE primitives.
    b)  I understand  how control  flow is  modeled using  gotos between
        basic blocks.
    c)  I can visualize the CFG of a program given it's GIMPLE dumps.
    d)  Given a GIMPLE dump, I can rebuild the original C program.
4)  I can see that compilation is a sequence of transformations.
5)  I can  create interesting input  programs for understanding  a given
    transformation by looking at input and output dumps.
