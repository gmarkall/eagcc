Problem statement
-----------------

        Add spim  level 1 to  gcc and  build cc1. Compile  the following
        program  with  the generated  cc1.  

        (a) For each statement in the program identify the corresponding
            GIMPLE statements (dump file with extension ".gimple").
        (b) For  each GIMPLE  statement identify  the corresponding  RTL
            statement (dump file with extension ".expand").
        (c) For each RTL statement,  identify the corresponding assembly
            statements (dump file with extension ".s").

Test case
---------

       int x, y;
       int main ()
       {
              int a, b, c;
              a = b;
              x = a + b;
              c=1;
              y = c;
       }

Procedure
---------

       1) Build cc1 with spim as target machine. 

       2) Compiling C program for spim        

          $BUILD/gcc/cc1 <c_file> -fdump-tree-gimple -fdump-rtl-expand
