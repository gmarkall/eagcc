GNU Make
========

        GNU  make utility  determines  automatically which  pieces  of a  large
        program need  to be  recompiled, and issues  the commands  to recompile
        them.

        make [TARGET1] [TARGET2] ...        Make can be invoked  with a list of
                                            target names, TARGET1, TARGET2, ...

        $@        The file name of the target
        $<        The name of the first dependency
        $*        The part of a filename which matched a suffix rule
        $?        The names of all the dependencies (seperated by spaces) newer
                  than the target
        $^        The names of all the  dependencies (separated by spaces), but
                  with duplicate names removed
        $+        The names of all the  dependencies (separated by spaces) with
                  duplicate names included and in the same order as in the rule
