Problem Statement
-----------------

        1) What is  the value of vectorization  factor for a machine  having 128
           bit vector registers? Does it depends on data type? If so, How?

        2) For the code given below, do the following:
                a) Identify  for what  values of  'X' the  given program  can be
                   vectorized (Note: X is an integer constant). Try to vectorize
                   the  code using  gcc-4.7.2 for  different values  of 'X'  and
                   verify your claim.

                b) For  some values  of 'X'  vectorization is  not performed  by
                   gcc-4.7.2. Give an explanation for it.

                c) If  vectorization is  possible, are  all the  loop iterations
                   part of vectorized loop? If not explain why?

        #include"stdio.h"
        int A[256];
        int main ()
        {
                int i;
                for (i=0; i<251; i++) {
                        A[i] = A[i-X];   /* S1 */
                }
                return 0;
        }
