Optional problem answers:

1. Change to compiler to exit with error one negative constants made. However,
this does not error for all negative constants because some don't match mulsi3
due to strength reduction in gimple.

2. The multiplication is implemented as an add pattern instead, so it doesn't
use the mulsi3 defined here. (Strength reduction).

3. These are transformed into bit-shifts and combinations of them in gimple so
again mulsi3 is not used. This is why there are only a certain range of allowed
values for N in the initial part of the problem, to ensure the mulsi3 pattern is
used.
