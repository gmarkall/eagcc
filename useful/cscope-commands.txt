cscope Utility
==============


Options
-------
        
        -C          Ignore letter-case when searching
        -q          Enable  fast  symbol lookup  via  an  inverted index.  This
                    option causes cscope to create 2 more files (default names:
                    cscope.in.out and cscope.po.out)
        -R          Recurse sub-directories during search
        <files>     Build index  file for all  <files> and search  for keywords
                    only in these
                    For example, cscope *.* searches in all files including the
                    non-C language source files
