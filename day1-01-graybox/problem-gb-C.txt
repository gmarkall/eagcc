C++ Virtual Function Assignment
 ------------------------------

        Let's  us examine  the behaviour  of  virtual functions.  There are  two
        versions of  code. vf-1.cpp contains  cout statements to  understand the
        vtable better.  vf-2.cpp is a copy  of vf-1.cpp is created  without cout
        statements to read cfg and assembly dumps.
       
        Source file: vf-1.cpp vf-2.cpp
        Compilation: g++-4.7.2 -fdump-tree-all vf-1.cpp
                     g++-4.7.2 -fdump-tree-all -S -fverbose-asm vf-2.cpp
        
        
Questions
---------
        1 Examine class dump.
          View Results: ./a.out > vf-1.out 
                        vi -O vf-1.cpp vf-2.cpp.002t.class vf-1.out

          Compare the results of vf-1.out with the vtable present in class dump.
          Do they match? Why or why not?

        2 Examine cfg dump.
          View Results: vi -O vf-2.cpp vf-2.cpp.014t.cfg   

          a) Look  at  main  function.  Each  declaration of  an  object  has  a
             constructor  call.   Examine  the  function  definition   of  class
             constructors.  Why does  the constructor  of child  class call  its
             parent class? What does it imply?

          b) Check assignments of array[0], array[1]  and array[2] with the main
             program. Are they different? Why or Why not?

          c) Check  for  function  calls.  The function  calls  are  changed  to
             dereferncing the pointer. Find the statements that

              1. Dereference object pointer to access the virtual function table
              2. Add offset  to the  base of  the table  to access  the function
                 pointer
              3. Dereference the function pointer to make the call

        3  Examine the assembly dumps.   
           View Results: vi -O vf-2.cpp.014t.cfg vf-2.s

           a) Examine  function definitions.  The  assembly  dumps have  mangled
              names for  function definition.Compare it with  function header of
              cfg file.

           b) Examine main function.Check for function calls. The function calls
              are changed to dereferncing the pointer. Find the statements that
              
              1. Dereference object pointer to access the virtual function table
              2. Add offset  to the  base of  the table  to access  the function
                 pointer
              3. Dereference the function pointer to make the call
