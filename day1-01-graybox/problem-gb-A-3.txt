A-3 Loops
---------

        Compile the following program (file A-3.c) and observe the dumps.

	Source file : A-3.c
	Compilation : gcc-4.7.2 -c -fdump-tree-cfg A-3.c
	View result : vi -O A-3.c A-3.c.*.cfg
	Clear dumps : rm -f A-3.c.* A-3.o

Program
-------

        int main()
        {
    	    int sum = 0;
    	    int i, j;
    
    	    while(sum < 100) {
    		    sum = sum * 2;
    	    }
    
    	    for(i=0; i<25; i++) {
    		    for(j=0; j<50; j++) {
    			    sum = sum + i*j;
    		    }
    	    }
        }

Questions
---------

        1   Identify the basic blocks that correspond  to the while loop. How is
            the GIMPLE for a while loop different from simple if-else jumps?

        2   Identify the  basic blocks  for the nested  for-loop. You  should be
            able  to identify  intializers, conditions  and increments  for each
            loop as  well as  the shared  inner body.  Is there  really anything
            special about a for-loop as compared to a while-loop?
