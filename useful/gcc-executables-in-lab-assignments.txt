Executables in Lab Assignments
------------------------------

Note that  all the lab assignments  refer to "gcc-4.7.2" as  the executable name
for gcc (version 4.7.2). But the name of the executable may be different on your
own machine. In the commands of the assignments, please replace "gcc-4.7.2" with
the gcc  executable (version 4.7.2)  installed on your  own machine. On  our lab
machines, the executable name of gcc (version 4.7.2) is "gcc-4.7.2".

Similarly, the lab  assignments refer to "g++-4.7.2" as the  executable name for
g++ (version 4.7.2).

In any  case, before using  the executable,  it is a  good practice to  know its
version. You can check this by using "--version" parameter with the executable.
