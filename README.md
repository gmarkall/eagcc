Day 2 solutions:
----------------

LTO exercise: not present here - mostly an exploratory exercise observing
various dumps of LTO in operation in partitioned and non-partitioned mode

GCC Building: Not present - Built GCC and inspected dependencies in various
Makefile.in files, but could not get the build browser tool to work (discrepancy
between the format of make.log and the version of the tool? - some internal
error occurred)
