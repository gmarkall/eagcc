6) With respect to the loop shown below, do the following
	a) Explain difficulties in parallelizing the loop.
	b) Construct the linear diophantine equation which expresses dependence in loop.
	c) State and apply suitable transformation to parallelize the loop. 
            [Hint: Find the iterations which are dependent]



int main()
{	
	int A[5000],B[5000],i;

	for(i=0;i<=100;i++)
	{	
		A[11*i] = A[12*i+3] * B[i];	
	}

	return 0;
}
