Solution 1
----------

Starting in recog function:

Reason                                Label
------                                -----

Because the code is a set:            L13
fall-through to L2:                   L2
Because the code is pc:               L7
It's an if-then-else:                 L141
condition is lessthan/equal:          L205
operand is a register:                L206
other operand is a register:          L207
taken branch is a label:              L208
fall-through to L209:                 L209
not-taken branch is PC:               Return 36, code for insn_ble


Solution 2:
-----------

L13 implies set
L240/L14 implies reg in SI mode
L241/L23 implies another reg in SI mode
L243 implies not a symbolic operand
L29/L246 implies another register operand in SI mode
L33 implies plus
L34 returns 10 for non-memory operand

add instruction with three register operands in SI mode, last one may be
register or constant, i.e.:

(define_insn "addsi3)
        [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "=r,r")
              (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "register_operand" "r,r")
                       (match_operand:SI 2 "nonmemory_operand" "r,K"))
         )]
)
