B-1 Function Inlining
---------------------

        In this program we  observe how the code of a function  is placed in the
        position of  its call if  doing so does not  increase the code  size too
        much.

        Source file : B-1.c
        Compilation : gcc-4.7.2 -c -O2 -fdump-tree-all B-1.c
        View result : vi -O B-1.c.*.ssa B-1.c.*.einline 
        Clear dumps : rm -f B-1.c.* B-1.o

        Note: On some older versions of gcc the pass may be named "einline2".

Program
-------

        int AddTwo(int a)
        {
            a = a + 2;
            return a;
        }

        int main()
        {
            int x = 3;
            x = AddTwo(x);
            return x;
        }

Questions
---------

        1   The body  of AddTwo(x)  seems to  be inlined into  the call  of main
            rendering the function useless (nobody else is calling it). Then why
            is the definition of AddTwo(x) still there all the way till the last
            pass (B-1.c.*.optimized)?

        2   Is there any way to get rid of it?
