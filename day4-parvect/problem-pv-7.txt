7) Parallelization has the overhead of thread creation, scheduling and synchronization, it is beneficial to do parallelization only
   when the loop body has sufficient computation to justify the overhead occured. 
   With respect to the loop shown below, do the following
	a) Fuse Loop-1 and Loop-2.
	b) After performing loop fusion, is the new program semantically equivalent to the original program?. Explain.
	c) Cost of executing S1 is C1.
	   Cost of executing S2 is C2.
	   Cost of executing S1, S2 together is C3.
	   C3 < C1+C2
           Apply suitable transformations to parallelize the fused loop.
           Show that cost of executing transformed loop is less than cost of executing original loops.


int main()
{
	int A[10000],B[10000];
	int n=9000,i;

	for(i=0;i<=n;i++) // Loop-1
	{
		A[i]= A[i] + B[i+3]; //S1
	}	

	for(i=0;i<=n;i++) // Loop-2
	{
		A[i+2]= B[i] + A[i+2]; //S2
	}

	return 0;
}
